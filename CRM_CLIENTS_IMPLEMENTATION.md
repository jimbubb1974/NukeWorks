# CRM Clients Implementation - Step 1 Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-05
**Status:** ✅ Database Schema and Models Complete

---

## Overview

Implemented a separate **Clients** table for CRM features, keeping it distinct from the Owners_Developers table while allowing flexible linking between entities.

## What Was Completed

### 1. Database Migration (003_add_clients_crm.sql) ✅

Created migration file: `/migrations/003_add_clients_crm.sql`

**New Tables:**
- `clients` - Main CRM client table
- `client_owner_relationships` - Link clients to owners/developers
- `client_project_relationships` - Link clients to projects
- `client_vendor_relationships` - Link clients to technology vendors
- `client_operator_relationships` - Link clients to operators
- `client_personnel_relationships` - Link clients to key personnel

**Enhanced Tables:**
- `roundtable_history` - Added CRM-specific fields:
  - `next_steps` - Next steps for the client
  - `client_near_term_focus` - What client is focusing on
  - `mpr_work_targets` - MPR's goals/targets for this client

### 2. SQLAlchemy Models ✅

Created **Client Model** (`app/models/client.py`):
```python
class Client(Base, TimestampMixin):
    # Basic Information
    client_name, client_type, notes

    # MPR Relationship
    mpr_primary_poc, mpr_secondary_poc

    # Contact Tracking (All Users)
    last_contact_date, last_contact_type, last_contact_by, last_contact_notes
    next_planned_contact_date, next_planned_contact_type, next_planned_contact_assigned_to

    # Internal Assessment (NED Team Only)
    relationship_strength, relationship_notes, client_priority, client_status
```

Created **Relationship Models** (added to `app/models/relationships.py`):
- `ClientOwnerRelationship`
- `ClientProjectRelationship`
- `ClientVendorRelationship`
- `ClientOperatorRelationship`
- `ClientPersonnelRelationship`

Updated **RoundtableHistory Model** (`app/models/roundtable.py`):
- Added `next_steps`, `client_near_term_focus`, `mpr_work_targets` fields
- Updated `to_dict()` method to include new fields

Updated **Models Index** (`app/models/__init__.py`):
- Exported all new models

## Relationship Capabilities

### Scenario 1: Client is an Owner/Developer
```
Client: "ABC Utility Company"
  ↓ (via client_owner_relationships)

## How to Apply Migration

### Check Current Schema Version
```bash
flask check-migrations
```

### Apply Migration
```bash
flask apply-migrations
```

This will:
1. Create automatic backup
2. Apply migration 003
3. Update schema_version table
4. Rollback automatically if any errors occur

## Next Steps

### Step 2: Implement Clients CRUD Operations
Following the vendor pattern (`VENDOR_CRUD_IMPLEMENTATION.md`):
- [ ] Create `app/forms/clients.py` with ClientForm, DeleteClientForm
- [ ] Create `app/routes/clients.py` with full CRUD routes
- [ ] Create templates:
  - [ ] `templates/clients/list.html`
  - [ ] `templates/clients/detail.html`
  - [ ] `templates/clients/form.html`
  - [ ] `templates/clients/delete.html`

### Step 3: Build CRM Dashboard
- [ ] Enhance `/crm/dashboard` route
- [ ] Show clients with roundtable data
- [ ] Filter by priority, status, MPR POC
- [ ] Show "clients needing attention" alerts

### Step 4: Create Roundtable Meeting Interface
- [ ] Create `/crm/roundtable` view
- [ ] Structured note-taking for:
  - Next steps
  - Client near-term focus areas
  - MPR work targets/goals
  - General notes
- [ ] Save to roundtable_history with new fields

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Separate Clients from Owners_Developers?

**Problem:** Not all clients are owners/developers. Some are consultants, prospects, or other types of relationships.

**Solution:**
- Created separate `clients` table for CRM tracking
- Can link clients to owners when appropriate via `client_owner_relationships`
- Allows maximum flexibility for various client types

### Why Add Fields to Roundtable_History?

**Problem:** Roundtable meetings need structured data capture for CRM use case.

**Solution:**
- Added `next_steps` - actionable items
- Added `client_near_term_focus` - what client is working on
- Added `mpr_work_targets` - MPR's goals for this relationship
- Kept existing `discussion` and `action_items` for general notes

### Access Control

**All Users Can See:**
- Client name, type, notes
- MPR points of contact
- Contact tracking (dates, types, summaries)
- Linked entities (projects, vendors, etc.)

**NED Team Only:**
- Relationship strength
- Relationship notes
- Client priority
- Client status
- Roundtable history

## Database Schema Summary
