# You can generate one using: python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here-change-this-in-production

# Database Configuration
# For development: local database path
# For production: network drive path (e.g., \\networkdrive\nuclear_projects\nukeworks_db.sqlite)
NUKEWORKS_DB_PATH=/path/to/nukeworks_db.sqlite

# Development Database Path (optional, overrides NUKEWORKS_DB_PATH in development)
# DEV_DB_PATH=/path/to/dev_nukeworks.sqlite

# Snapshot Directory (for database backups)

# Master Encryption Keys for Field-Level Encryption
# Generate your own keys by running: python scripts/generate_encryption_keys.py
# IMPORTANT: Use different keys for each environment (dev, production)
CONFIDENTIAL_DATA_KEY=YOUR_CONFIDENTIAL_KEY_HERE
NED_TEAM_KEY=YOUR_NED_TEAM_KEY_HERE

# Security Notes:
# 1. NEVER commit .env to version control
# 2. Generate unique keys for each environment
# 3. Back up encryption keys securely - data cannot be recovered without them
# 4. Store production keys in a secure vault or password manager
