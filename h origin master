    feat: integrate roundtable auto-timestamping and smart form pre-population
    
    Merge roundtable improvements from commit cc0bf83 into current codebase.
    
    Backend Changes:
    - RoundtableHistoryForm: Removed manual meeting_date field
    - CRM routes: Already supports automatic created_timestamp on entry creation
    - Form pre-population: Auto-loads most recent entry data for editing efficiency
    
    Frontend Changes:
    - Roundtable form now shows edit pencil buttons when previous entries exist
    - Fields display previous entry values (read-only) with toggle to edit
    - JavaScript: Auto-resize textareas, readonly field management, form submission handling
    - Sidebar improvements: Company Personnel and Company Information sections are collapsible
    
    Benefits:
    - No more date picking - system auto-timestamps when entries are saved
    - Less data re-entry - previous entry values pre-fill form
    - Better UX - single-click field editing with visual feedback
    - Preserved all existing functionality from current branch
    
    Files Modified:
    - app/forms/roundtable.py: Removed meeting_date from RoundtableHistoryForm
    - app/routes/crm.py: Added pre-population logic (already existed, verified)
    - app/templates/crm/dashboard.html: Simplified layout, moved filters to bottom
    - app/templates/crm/roundtable_form.html: Added edit toggle UI and JavaScript
