## Test 1: Direct Database Access (DB Browser)

**Goal:** Verify that even with direct file access, confidential data cannot be read.

### Steps:

1. **Open the database in DB Browser for SQLite**
   - Open `dev_nukeworks.sqlite`

2. **Navigate to the `projects` table**
   - Click "Browse Data" tab
   - Select "projects" table
   - Find row with `project_id = 1` (Darlington New Nuclear Project Unit 1)

3. **Examine the encrypted columns**
   - Look at `capex_encrypted` column
   - Look at `opex_encrypted` column
   - Look at `fuel_cost_encrypted` column
   - Look at `lcoe_encrypted` column

**Expected Result:**
```
capex_encrypted: gAAAAABo8BIqrLSnVRhRA-XfhYlKGZYUEYhE3HbYM7IKAm6SOzc7z6O...
opex_encrypted: gAAAAABo8BIqD3kZvN8... (binary gibberish)
```

**✅ PASS:** You see binary encrypted data that is completely unreadable.
**❌ FAIL:** You can see the actual dollar amounts.

4. **Navigate to the `client_profiles` table**
   - Find row with `company_id = 37`
   - Look at `relationship_strength_encrypted` column
   - Look at `relationship_notes_encrypted` column

**Expected Result:**
```
relationship_strength_encrypted: gAAAAABo8BIq9-NS4HD7IN9aurWWJuvSpcf18KDD...
relationship_notes_encrypted: gAAAAABo8BIqVpN8pAeqBQenXjIDl9dEI8Xkms... (gibberish)
```

**✅ PASS:** You see binary encrypted data - cannot read "Strong", "High", etc.
**❌ FAIL:** You can read the actual CRM assessment text.

5. **Navigate to the `roundtable_history` table**
   - Find row with `history_id = 1`
   - Look at `discussion_encrypted` column
   - Look at `action_items_encrypted` column

**Expected Result:**
```
discussion_encrypted: gAAAAABo8BIqLw2DUm8dWGTdLX4sIXBuJD4fs02c9H3C...
action_items_encrypted: gAAAAABo8BIqIefEq5YSVeL8vEL0RL85HsuW_YWSRdzN... (gibberish)
```

**✅ PASS:** Meeting notes are completely unreadable binary data.
**❌ FAIL:** You can read the actual meeting discussion.

## Test 4: Database File Theft Scenario

**Goal:** Simulate an attacker stealing the database file.

### Scenario:

An attacker gains access to your server and copies `dev_nukeworks.sqlite` to their own machine.

### Attack Steps:

1. **Attacker opens database in DB Browser**
2. **Attacker queries the projects table:**
   ```sql
   SELECT project_name, capex, capex_encrypted, opex FROM projects;
   ```

**What the attacker sees:**
```
project_name: Darlington New Nuclear Project Unit 1
capex: NULL (old column is empty)
capex_encrypted: gAAAAABo8BIqrLSnVRhRA-XfhYlKGZYUEYhE3HbYM7IKAm6SOzc7... (gibberish)
opex: NULL
```

3. **Attacker tries to decrypt manually:**
   - Without the encryption keys stored in your `.env` file on the server
   - Without knowing which encryption algorithm was used
   - Fernet encryption requires a 32-byte base64-encoded key

**Result:** ❌ **ATTACK FAILED**
- Cannot read financial data
- Cannot read CRM assessments
- Cannot read meeting notes
- All confidential information is protected

**✅ PASS:** Database theft does not reveal confidential information.
**❌ FAIL:** Attacker can read sensitive data from stolen database.

## Test 5: Verify Encryption Keys are Secure

**Goal:** Confirm that encryption keys are not stored in the database.

### Steps:

1. **Open database in DB Browser**
2. **Search all tables for encryption keys:**
   - Search for "CONFIDENTIAL_DATA_KEY"
   - Search for "NED_TEAM_KEY"
   - Search for the actual key values from your `.env` file

**Expected Result:**
- ❌ Keys are NOT found anywhere in the database
- ✅ Keys are only in `.env` file on server (not in git, not in database)

**✅ PASS:** Encryption keys are not stored in database.
**❌ FAIL:** Can find encryption keys in database.

3. **Check that `.env` is in `.gitignore`:**
   ```bash
   grep "^\.env$" .gitignore
   ```

**Expected:** `.env` is listed in `.gitignore`

**✅ PASS:** .env file will not be committed to git.
**❌ FAIL:** .env is not in .gitignore (security risk!).

## Summary of Security Layers

### What's Protected:

✅ **Layer 1: Field-Level Encryption**
- Financial data (CAPEX, OPEX, Fuel Cost, LCOE)
- CRM assessments (relationship strength, priority, status, notes)
- Meeting notes (roundtable discussions, action items)
- All encrypted with Fernet (AES-128 in CBC mode)

✅ **Layer 2: Permission-Based Decryption**
- Two-tier access system:
  - Tier 1: `has_confidential_access` for financial data
  - Tier 2: `is_ned_team` for internal CRM/meeting notes
- Automatic decryption based on user permissions
- No manual key management required

✅ **Layer 3: Key Protection**
- Master keys stored in `.env` (not in database, not in git)
- Keys are 32-byte cryptographically random values
- Server-side only (never sent to browser)

### What's NOT Protected:

❌ **Database File Encryption**
- SQLCipher was not implemented (Windows build issues)
- Database file can be opened by anyone
- However, encrypted columns are still gibberish

❌ **Metadata**
- Project names, company names, etc. are still readable
- Table structure is visible
- Relationships between entities are visible
- Only the VALUES in sensitive fields are encrypted

---

## Conclusion

**Encryption Status:** ✅ **WORKING**

**Security Assessment:**
- Database theft does NOT reveal confidential financial data
- Database theft does NOT reveal confidential CRM assessments
- Database theft does NOT reveal confidential meeting notes
- Only users with proper permissions can decrypt data via the Flask app
- Encryption keys are secured outside the database

**Recommendation:**
- ✅ Safe to deploy - sensitive data is protected
- ✅ Users can be granted/revoked access via permission flags
- ✅ Database backups are safe (encrypted data remains encrypted)
- ⚠️ Consider additional server-level security (filesystem encryption, access controls)

---

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Migrate Existing Data:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/migrate_data_to_encrypted.py dev_nukeworks.sqlite
   ```
   This will encrypt any existing plain-text data in old columns.

2. **Remove Old Columns (After Validation):**
   - After confirming encryption works in production
   - Create migration to drop old `capex`, `opex`, etc. columns
   - Reduces attack surface (no plain-text columns at all)

3. **Key Rotation Procedure:**
   - Document procedure to rotate encryption keys
   - Would require re-encrypting all data with new keys

4. **Filesystem Encryption:**
   - Consider enabling BitLocker (Windows) or dm-crypt (Linux)
   - Adds defense-in-depth (encrypted file + encrypted columns)
