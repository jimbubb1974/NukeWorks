# Encryption Implementation Status

**Last Updated:** October 2025
**Status:** Phase 3a COMPLETE - Project financial fields encrypted

---

## Overview

Per-field encryption for sensitive data is being implemented in phases to protect confidential financial data and NED Team internal notes. This document tracks which encryption phases are implemented vs. pending.

**Key Principles:**
- Encrypted fields use 'confidential' or 'ned_team' encryption keys
- Access control enforced through user permission flags: `has_confidential_access` or `is_ned_team`
- Non-authorized users see placeholder text like `[Confidential]` or `[NED Team Only]`
- Backward compatibility maintained: old plaintext columns retained during transition

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 3a: Project Financial Fields ‚úÖ COMPLETE (October 2025)

**Status:** LIVE IN PRODUCTION

**Encrypted Fields:**
- `capex` (Capital Expenditure) - Financial data
- `opex` (Operating Expenditure) - Financial data
- `fuel_cost` (Fuel costs) - Financial data
- `lcoe` (Levelized cost of energy) - Financial metric

**Encryption Key:** `'confidential'`

**Access Required:** `has_confidential_access=True`

**Display for Non-Authorized Users:** `[Confidential]`

**Database Changes:**
- Added new BLOB columns: `capex_encrypted`, `opex_encrypted`, `fuel_cost_encrypted`, `lcoe_encrypted`
- Old plaintext columns (`capex`, `opex`, `fuel_cost`, `lcoe`) retained for backward compatibility
- Not yet removed (pending full data migration validation)

**Implementation Details:**
- **Model File:** `app/models/project.py`
- **Field Implementation:** `EncryptedField` descriptor with 3 parameters:
  ```python
  capex = EncryptedField('_capex_encrypted', 'confidential', '[Confidential]')
  ```
- **Encryption Mechanism:** Uses 'confidential' key from encryption system
- **Data Type Conversion:** Float ‚Üí String (for precision) ‚Üí Encrypted BLOB
- **Decryption:** BLOB ‚Üí String ‚Üí Float on read

**Testing Status:**
- ‚úÖ Encrypted values stored correctly
- ‚úÖ Decryption working for authorized users
- ‚úÖ Access control enforced (non-authorized see placeholder)
- ‚úÖ Forms save encrypted data
- ‚úÖ Reports handle encrypted fields

**Migration Path:**
1. ‚úÖ Added encrypted columns to database (non-breaking migration)
2. ‚è≥ Data migration script ready (pending scheduling)
3. üìã After validation period: consider removing old plaintext columns

### Phase 3b: ClientProfile NED Team Fields ‚è≥ PENDING

**Target Status:** Ready to implement

**Encrypted Fields:**
- `relationship_strength` (e.g., "Strong", "Good", "Needs Attention")
- `relationship_notes` - Internal assessment notes
- `client_priority` (e.g., "High", "Medium", "Low")
- `client_status` (e.g., "Active", "Warm", "Cold")

**Encryption Key:** `'ned_team'`

**Access Required:** `is_ned_team=True`

**Display for Non-Authorized Users:** `[NED Team Only]`

**Database Impact:**
- Will add columns: `relationship_strength_encrypted`, `relationship_notes_encrypted`, `client_priority_encrypted`, `client_status_encrypted`
- Old plaintext columns will be retained initially

**Status Details:**

**Target Status:** Ready to implement

**Encrypted Fields:**
- `discussion` - Meeting discussion notes
- `action_items` - Action items from meeting
- `next_steps` - Next steps for client
- `client_near_term_focus` - What client is focusing on
- `mpr_work_targets` - MPR's internal goals for client

**Encryption Key:** `'ned_team'`

**Access Required:** `is_ned_team=True`

**Display for Non-Authorized Users:** `[NED Team Only]`

**Database Impact:**
- Will add 5 encrypted columns to `roundtable_history` table

- Access controlled at row level during queries

---

### Phase 3d: CompanyRoleAssignment Notes ‚è≥ PENDING

**Target Status:** Ready to implement (after Phase 3b & 3c)

**Encrypted Field:**
- `notes` - Conditional encryption only if `is_confidential=True`

**Encryption Key:** `'confidential'`

**Access Required:** `has_confidential_access=True` (only if is_confidential=True)

**Database Impact:**
- Will add column: `notes_encrypted`
- Old plaintext column retained initially

**Status Details:**
- üìã Implementation plan drafted
- ‚è≥ Awaiting execution (lower priority than other phases)

**Unique Aspect:**
- **Conditional Encryption**: Only encrypt if `is_confidential` flag is set
- Non-confidential assignments have plaintext notes
- Confidential assignments have encrypted notes

---

### Phase 3e: InternalExternalLink NED Team Fields ‚è≥ PENDING

**Target Status:** Ready to implement (final phase)

**Encrypted Fields:**
- `relationship_strength` - Internal assessment of relationship
- `notes` - Internal notes about relationship

**Encryption Key:** `'ned_team'`

**Access Required:** `is_ned_team=True`

**Database Impact:**
- Will add 2 encrypted columns to `internal_external_links` table

**Status Details:**
- üìã Implementation plan drafted
- ‚è≥ Lower priority (may combine with other company model updates)

**Notes:**
- Tracks internal assessments of company-to-company relationships
- Foreign keys and relationship types remain plaintext (needed for queries)

## Current Implementation Details

### Active Encryption System

**Model File:** `app/models/confidential.py`

**Key Types:**
1. **'confidential'** - Financial and business data
   - Requires: `has_confidential_access=True`
   - Used for: Project CAPEX, OPEX, LCOE, fuel costs
2. **'ned_team'** - Internal team assessments
   - Requires: `is_ned_team=True`
   - Used for: Client profiles, roundtable notes, internal links (pending)

**EncryptedField Implementation:**

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, LargeBinary
from app.models.confidential import EncryptedField

class Project(Base):
    # Database storage columns (BLOB type)
    _capex_encrypted = Column('capex_encrypted', LargeBinary)

    # Property with automatic encryption/decryption
    capex = EncryptedField('_capex_encrypted', 'confidential', '[Confidential]')
```

**How It Works:**
1. On write: User enters float value ‚Üí Converted to string ‚Üí Encrypted with 'confidential' key ‚Üí Stored as BLOB
2. On read:
   - If user has `has_confidential_access=True`: BLOB decrypted ‚Üí Converted to float ‚Üí Returns actual value
   - Otherwise: Returns placeholder `[Confidential]`
3. Queries still work: Plaintext columns can still be queried (during transition)

### Access Control Integration

**Permission Checks:**
- Encryption key 'confidential' checks: `user.has_confidential_access`
- Encryption key 'ned_team' checks: `user.is_ned_team`
- See `05_PERMISSION_SYSTEM.md` for complete permission logic

**Display Behavior:**
- Views/templates show placeholder for non-authorized users
- Forms disable editing of confidential fields for non-authorized users
- Reports omit encrypted data for non-authorized users

## Migration Approach (General Pattern)

Each phase follows this pattern:

### Step 1: Schema Update (Non-Breaking)
```sql
ALTER TABLE [table] ADD COLUMN [field]_encrypted BLOB;
```
‚úÖ Old plaintext columns remain
‚úÖ Can add indexes on new encrypted columns
‚úÖ No data loss

### Step 2: Data Migration
```python
# Migration script:
# 1. Read plaintext values
# 2. Encrypt with appropriate key
# 3. Store in _encrypted columns
# 4. Validate encryption worked
```

### Step 3: Model Updates
- Add EncryptedField properties
- Update to use encrypted columns for reads
- Fallback to plaintext if encrypted column empty

### Step 4: Validation Period
- Monitor application for issues
- Verify encrypted data can be decrypted
- Ensure access control working
- Collect user feedback

### Step 5: Optional Cleanup (Future)
- After 1-2 months of stability
- Drop old plaintext columns
- Rename encrypted columns to original names (optional)

## Testing Checklist

Use this checklist when implementing each phase:

### Data Integrity
- [ ] All plaintext values successfully encrypted
- [ ] Encrypted values can be decrypted back to original
- [ ] Data types preserved (floats stay floats, text stays text)
- [ ] NULL values handled correctly

### Access Control
- [ ] Users with proper permission see actual values
- [ ] Users without permission see placeholder text
- [ ] Admins bypass encryption (if applicable)
- [ ] Permission checks happen on every read

### Application Functionality
- [ ] Forms can save encrypted data
- [ ] Reports display correctly (placeholder for non-authorized)
- [ ] Queries/filters still work
- [ ] Charts/graphs handle encrypted fields
- [ ] Exports include placeholder text for non-authorized users

### Database
- [ ] Encrypted columns have proper indexes
- [ ] Backup/restore works with encrypted data
- [ ] Database file size reasonable (encrypted vs. plaintext)
- [ ] Performance acceptable

---

## Known Limitations & Notes

### During Transition Period
- Old plaintext columns still in database
- Both old and new columns must be kept in sync initially
- Some queries may use plaintext, others use encrypted
- Database size larger than final state (both columns present)

### Encryption Approach
- Field-level encryption (not row-level or column-level)
- Transparent to application code (use properties normally)
- No encrypted search (encrypted values not searchable)
- Requires decryption for any filtering on encrypted fields

### Performance Considerations
- Encryption/decryption adds slight CPU overhead
- Queries that don't need encrypted data unaffected
- Filtered queries on encrypted fields require full table scan
- Index queries on encrypted columns not possible (as planned)
